#About

This is a grid-based side-scrolling game that started out as a simple concept, but has since become a fully-fledged project of mine.
Let's be honest, I'm a programmer not an artist!
These graphics derive from some classic NES titles such as Mega Man (Capcom), Mario (Nintendo), and Sonic The Hedgehog (Sega).
I claim no ownership of these sprites and this game is not meant for commercial use.
It is merely a demonstration of my Java abilities.

#Demo

A playable demo is hosted on my website which can be found [here](http://jbull.ca/#work-processing-terrace). It uses processing.js and does not support the map import feature.
